\# 🧪 LLM Evaluation – Serilog Issue #2176



🔗 \[GitHub Issue](https://github.com/serilog/serilog/issues/2176)



---



\## 🐛 Problem Summary



In Serilog v2.12.0, logging inside a `using` block works, but any logging call using `Log.Information()` \*\*after disposal\*\* throws:



System.ObjectDisposedException: Cannot access a disposed object.

\## 🧠 LLM Prompt



> I'm using Serilog and after logging inside a `using` block, I call `Log.Information(...)` again and it throws ObjectDisposedException.  

> How do I safely log after disposal?



---



\## 🤖 LLM Response



ChatGPT explained:

\- Avoid mixing `using` with static `Log` calls.

\- Use `Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()` directly.

\- Call `Log.CloseAndFlush()` to dispose the logger explicitly at the end.



---



\## 🧪 Human Validation



\- ✅ Reproduced error using `using (...) { }` pattern and `Log.Information()` after disposal.

\- ✅ Rewrote using `Log.Logger = ...` and added `Log.CloseAndFlush()` → Works without exception.

\## ✅ Verdict



✅ \*\*Correct and actionable\*\* – LLM provided an accurate solution and correct reasoning.
